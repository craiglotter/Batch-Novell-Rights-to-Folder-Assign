Batch Novell Rights to Folder Assign

Batch Novell Rights to Folder Assign is used to assign novell user objects specified access rights to specified folders and files. The user objects to be affected all appear in an input file using the following format:
.LTTCRA003.Students.com.main.uct

This application will only work correctly if trying to affect accounts over which the current logged-in Novell user has administration rights over.
